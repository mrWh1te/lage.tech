# Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (cPTSD)

cPTSD can be like a living nightmare that you never wake up from. Day and night, you struggle with an overwhelming, excruciating, indistinguishable level of stress and pain, emotional flashbacks, and night terrors, as it boxes you into a hyper vigiliant survival mode. It debilitates choice with frequent, if not constant, fight, flight, freeze or fawn responses. Without proper treatment, it can develop into a terror of dissociating darkness that completely enslaves you with a form of amnesia. You forget who you are, your likes, your positive feelings like joy or wonder, and even what your face looks like. Literally, you are not able to recognize yourself, when peering into a mirror. As time progresses, it becomes normal, eroding all your hope for a decent life.

I know this because I had an extreme case of cPTSD. And at its core, was horrific betrayal by parents and friends. It was best comparable to the descriptions of Dante's Inferno, where I was alone, broke & broken, without access to memory of what life was like before.

But, this article isn't about what happened to me. It's about what I found to do about it. Something you can do yourself.

In my moment of greatest terror, after hitting, what I thought was, rock bottom, I fell further down from the pits of hell. I became desparate, radical and full of rage. But, in that moment, I made the best choice for myself. I began to listen to the subtle whispers from my battered heart. It would take me years of listening and exploring before I began to recognize it, as I commonly referred to it as my ghost. But, it was hardly recognicable, as it was severely bruised, like an unkept chimney covered in soot. I was severely dissociated, for over 10 years that I forgot what it was like to even have a heart, I thought it was all made up like Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny, but thankfully I was wrong. There is a box, deep inside that makes feelings, but it was missing, it ran away, for all the right reasons and in its place was suffocating heart ache, that tore me apart from the inside out, a black hole.

But, us human beings are highly capable life forms with ancient programming. You see, it was in answering the call of my heart that I began to find my way, in steps, to do something that felt like a miracle, like magic, but in fact was real emotional alchemy.

# Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG)

PTG is the flipped side of the (c)PTSD coin. It's one in the same like love and hate. And, unknown to most, you can flip the coin, even years later. It's not only possible, but naturally normal, to convert cPTSD into PTG, as if we are programmed to do. I believe, it's the intended reaction of our genome, our DNA. fpr handling and converting trauma, but as to why the disorder is more common, is for another article.

PTG is a feature that is part of our nature, tucked away in the depths of our mind, to be used when needed, for personal evolution. That is why, in prolonged suffering from cPTSD, your heart will call out to you. It will sound confusing, faint, like a ghost's whisper, encouraging you to do things radically differently, at least at the start.

> Our minds are powerful emotional processors, capable of tremendous probabilistic calculations for pathing the future of our lives. These calculations are signals, feelings, communicated to us consciously for measured yielding.

That's what happened to me, in the last few months of 2012. I was completely lost and afraid, having no sense of self while surrounded by malignant narcissists, preying on me like vultures. I had been in hell for years, but I fell down even further after being betrayed by my last best friend. Yet, after losing it all, I became free to clearly see, in order to make a plan for my great escape. The plan would take years to complete, as I learnt to believe in myself again, learned to feel and process my emotions again, before I would succeed in this leap of faith, but it was the best decision of my life. To start completely over and to figure it all out for myself.

# Learn, heal & grow stronger

I began with the radical removal of everyone in my life. I cut out everyone with no prejudice and even put on a grandoise show of lunancy to keep myself away from them all. No going back, no giving up, no surrender. I left myself with one choice and one choice alone, go forward. I needed to figure it out, what I lost, figure out what I needed, figure out what I must do to take care of myself, through and through, no matter what.

</center>

But that is step one. Cutting out everyone. Go solo, no contact. No chance to learn incorrectly from others, good or bad. To give myself all the chances to prove to myself that I can, to learn it all over again, to feel everything out for myself without risking others' adulteration. And I mean every little thing. No rock unturned. No pain unfelt. All necessary, to stand on my own two feet.

> Some people dislike change, growth, hardship, etc. while holding highly limiting views as to what a human being can do and have the tendency to project that on others. "Misery loves company." But that isn't the real truth, as human beings have tremendous potential.

    alt="Step 2 - Building strengthening habits"
    width="50%"

</center>

Then comes the training, step two. cPTSD increases your sensitivity dramatically. And as much as sensitivity is confused as a weakness, and as overwhelming as it is with cPTSD, it is a misunderstood super power. Sensitivity is a form of emotinal intelligence that is greatly linked with the powerful probabilistic calculator of our subconscious. It can be like an Achilles' heel, but when paired with enough strength and energy, it's an epic capacity for deep perception. It enables people to read deeply into others, like an open book, as if they have telepathy.

So what you need to do is train your body & mind. Strengthen them until your sensitivity works for you. Start by minimizing pleasure of the body. You don't need to give up everything, and you don't have to do it all at once, but what softens the mind, depletes the body of its energy. 100%. We need that energy for something more. We must learn to harness it, control it, like our focus.

> Sensitivity, inner strength & high energy is a power combo

A lot of social media, TV, movies, games, bar hopping and other parts of popular culture weakens the mind's ability to control focus and discourages belief in oneself. Now, I make an exception for what inspires you, I found some movies and music quite helpful but avoid anything & everyone that is pessimistic or has belittling views and values. Frankly, most people don't have a fucking clue nor the desire to figure it out so don't listen to their crap! That will only prolong the time it takes to heal and grow strong, as it inhibits you. Learn to identify and accept weakening habits & replace them with self-strengthening ones, piece by piece, step by step. This took me the same number of years of falling deep into darkness.

> It is easier and more practical, to master the body before the mind

Cold showers, exercise, cooking your food, having a balanced diet, meditation, getting adequate sleep (which may flunctuate as you break through dissociation), sexual abstinence (which is a highly rewarding tough one that I GREATLY recommend), strengthens the body & boosts your energy levels tremendously. Reading books (e.g. philosophy, fiction, whatever your heart feels like reading), writing stories, journaling, learning new subjects like languages, developing social skills like enforcing boundaries, creating new healthy relationships, strengthens the mind. Exploring & spending time in nature resets the Circadian rhythm while giving you time to reacquaint yourself with who you truly are, in learning what works best for you, away from the toxicity of decrepit systems and subversive cultures. I have spent a highly rewarding year, living out of my car, traveling from national park to national park, roughing it. Give yourself all the space and time to meet yourself, piece by piece. There is no right way to do this, except to listen to yourself, to yeild to the feelings and sensations of the mind, body and heart.

Now for step three, consciously form your mind's foundation. After developing strength and energy, you will be able to direct your focus.

> Where your focus goes, your energy flows

So focus on believing yourself, your untapped potential and personal power. Belief is a powerful form of thought, not to be underestimated! Read that again, belief is a powerful form of thought. Some types of thought have inner consequences to our mind's structure affectings its power. You must take great prudence in what you believe, and who you believe in. Reject poisonous thoughts and accept uplifting ones. Say to yourself, on belitting intrusive thoughts, "I reject". It may not work at the start, but eventually it wll. Don't believe in other people, in whatever they have to say, even good, until you believe in yourself, first and foremost. It's okay to be wrong, that's part of the process, but if you don't start believing in yourself, how will you learn where your wrong is and where your right begins? How do you improve? Do this, step by step, in order to gain your own trust. Become familiar with who you truly can be, so you can believe in the safety of yourself (again).

That is what you go to do. You must change your way of life, so that your habits strengthen you, energize you. This will take power away from those who have over you by giving it back to you, with your intention. Many people, especially abusers, will hate you for this, so leave them out for now (they'll be useful later). But for now, put yourself first. It's way past time for you to be selfish. And you won't have to be selfish forever, just until you reunite with your heart and light (soul).

> Reignite your mind & body with your soul

After a while, you will learn to recognize & trust your self, trust and reply on the box that makes feelings, called your heart. Remember to pick it up, from the bottom of your mind, the dark abyss, and gently, softly, compassionately hug it with all the strengthened love you develop. It ran away. It's time to convince it that it's safe to stay. Do this over and over again, for every hurt you felt and every hurt you feel.

> This is how we relearn to process our emotions

Forgive yourself of past mistakes. We are all born weak, dependent and highly vulnerable. That is nothing to be ashamed of. Getting tricked as a kid, or a young adult, or even an old age, it's not something to hold against yourself. Never was. That's okay, because you have tremendous potential and personal power. You'll learn to protect it and fight for it, with your mind. It's not about having the biggest muscles or being the most intimidating, hardest individual, it's about having control over your mind, weilding it like a sharp sword, so you can slice down your enemies (ego's), if necessary. So you can be safe and feel safe in your own skin.

> It is through growth that we develop strength & courage

You will find pieces of yourself, frozen in traumatic times. Show each piece patient love and assurance, in greater and greater quantities. Show each piece no judgment, but strength, admiration and compassion, with the safety of your personal power that protects. You'll grow little by little, every single day. For me, I go and do fun things I enjoyed as a kid, from the time of the trauma, like watching anime movies in cinema. I show these pieces of myself that they are not forgotten. I show them that it is safe to come home, to assimilate back into the subconscious of being one (again). It takes persistance. There will be set backs, along the way, for it's not a straight path, but it's one of the most rewarding things any person can do. It's the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.

Then there is the pain, the heart ache, that block hole. Grieve it, all of it, all the loss. Accept all of it, every piece, no matter how ugly. Acceptance is another powerful form of thought. Each time you accept a hidden truth like an egregious set of circumstances, your mind grows, you become a bigger person. Things that were tough to handle will seem smaller to you, easier to deal with. Sometimes, you may find a piece of yourself holding back, preventing you from accepting a truth. Work with that piece, learn from it so it can ease off and assimilate. Then comes the acceptance.

After a while, maybe days, maybe months or maybe even years (like in my case), the pain & stress becomes tolerable, you start living a more normal life but triggers remain, inner scars haven't healed and you may feel stuck or resentful about this highly disciplined way of life, like it's not fair. At that point, it's time for the last step.

# Start scoring points

<center>
  <img
    src="/scoreboard-guest-winning.jpeg"
    alt="Scoreboard with the home team losing"
    width="50%"
  />
</center>

You need to score points, for your team, your side, yourself. Psychologists say that the "body keeps the score" and it's absolutely true. But, the buzzer of past trauma doesn't goes off, the game never ends. That's scary at the start but a blessing in the long run. Years later, after trauma, after abuse, you can still go back and put points on the board. With enough points, you'll flip the horror of (c)PTSD into PTG.

It's by leading the game in points, by scoring more than the abusers' team that you'll transfigure cPTSD into PTG. It can come in parts, but this is when the magic happens. This is emotional alchemy.

By this time, you'll have reconnected with yourself, your intuition, and thus understand how to play. The best part is that you'll do it in your own way, on your own terms that maximizes self respect. Do what makes you admire yourself. Listen to your nervous system. It will tell you when and for how long, you can play at a time. You must learn to listen & yeild to the messages of your mind, body and heart. Those feelings, the intuition, the sensitivities, fear, paranoia, all of it is there to guide you so let it. Listen to it. As you get stronger, as you use score more and more, it gets easier and easier. Healing and growth both compound.

So, once your ready (and you'll know when), reintroduce yourself to environments with abusive people. Maybe start with a phone call. But, stand up for yourself, and fight with your mind, using your tactics. Do not use their tactics, don't score points for the other team! That will confuse your body. It's an easy trap to fall into so focus on scoring for your's and everyone else on your side, in ways that your proud of. It often is as simple as calmly weilding words that you didn't realize you had until in the moment that you have. Those words are coming from your soul, your light, from who you truly are. Let it flow.

</center>

Ultimately, I can't tell you how to do this part, but I recommend keeping a cool head. You have to do the work, develop an intimate relationship with yourself, your mind, body and heart. You have to be able to listen & yeild to all the messages, the good and the bad. The angel and the demon, on your shoulders. None of that is inherently wrong, it's simply human. None of that is to be ashamed of. It is all 100% natural.

> Look "Beyond Good and Evil" by Friedrich Nietzsche

It's not about being nice to abusive people or giving them a second chance. It's about being your true, strengthened, proud self, in an environment with abusive people so you can create new memories that informs the body that the score has changed. That with your developed personal power, you are safe (again). Communicate in your grown up way that you respect & cherish. Only you will know, how you need to do this part. And frankly, you might not consciously know, but that won't matter, as long as you do the other steps because you'll be following your higher path that your light leads. It will illuminate the path, it will give you the words to say, and the actions to make.

> Create new memories, informing the body that you are safe in previously deemed dangerous environments and people. That you can now, take care of yourself, because you now know and are capable of fighting for yourself.

For every time you do, you'll score a point for your team. You don't have to it all at once. In fact, don't. It's not a race. It can start with a simple brief phone call. But then it becomes your game and you will get to use abusers, bullies, evil people, again and again and again, as they used you. It's only fair. Thus, by putting enough points on the board, making your team the definitive winning team, you will have transfigured cPTSD into PTG. You will have emotionally alchemized your pain into your power and in doing so, you will have learnt what it truly means to be a human being, through and through. That's something you can't quite put to words, but it will motivate you to live your best life, for the rest of your life.

# You can do it

This is all very hard to do, and may take many years, but it **is** possible. There is no expiration date, there is no time limit, there is no age too old, no pain too great. It's in your DNA. The answers are found within.

So, get out there, leave that environment and train yourself so one day, you can perform emotional alchemy.

Do it in small manageable steps, compound those life-growing victories. Don't bother consciously remembering the score, you don't have to think about it, in fact, you'll learn you don't have to think much anymore at all. Just learn to listen, let go & yield to the signals of your mind, body & heart. Get out of the way of your light. It will all give you the guidance, you need. It will all answer the questions you discover, along the way. It's quite magical.

Fight that darkness.

Get your power back. Your pain is your greatest source of power.

The greater the pain, the greater the power, the greater the strength and energy required to weild it.

Don't give up. Don't surrender. I believe in you.
