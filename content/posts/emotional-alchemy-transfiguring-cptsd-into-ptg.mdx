# Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (cPTSD)

cPTSD can be like a living nightmare that you never wake up from. Day and night, you struggle with an overwhelming, excruciating, indistinguishable level of stress and pain, emotional flashbacks, and night terrors, as it boxes you into a hyper vigiliant survival mode. It debilitates choice with frequent, if not constant, fight, flight, freeze or fawn responses. And without proper treatment, it can develop into a terror of dissociating darkness that completely enslaves you with amnesia. You forget who you are, your likes, your dislikes, your positive feelings like joy or wonder, and even your own face. Literally, you are not able to look into the mirror and recognize yourself. As time progresses, it becomes normal, eroding all hope for a decent life.

I know this because I had an extreme case of cPTSD. And at its core, was horrific betrayal by family and friends. At its worse, it was like living in Dante's Inferno, where I was left alone, broke & broken, with no memory of what life was like before.

But, this article isn't about that. It's about what I found to do about it. Something you can do yourself.

In my moment of greatest terror, after falling down from the pits of hell, I became desparate, radical and full of rage. But, in that moment, I made the best choice possible. I began to only listen to the subtle whispers of my soul. It would take years of listening and exploring before I began to recognize what I lost. My heart was missing and severely bruised. For over 7 years, I walked without, in the darkness of dissociative amnesia. I forgot what it was like to even have a heart. I thought it was all made up like Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny. But, there is a box, deep inside that makes feelings. Mine had ran away, as far as it could, for all the right reasons and in its place was suffocating heart ache, that tore me apart from the inside out, my black hole.

But, that wasn't the end. We, human beings, are highly capable wonderous biomachines, with ancient programming. You see, it was in answering the call of my soul that I began to find my way, in steps, to do something that was like a miracle, magical, real, emotional alchemy.

# Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG)

PTG is the flipped side of the (c)PTSD coin. It's one in the same like love and hate. And, unknown to most, you can flip the coin, even years later. It's not only possible, but naturally normal, to convert cPTSD into PTG, as if that is our programming. I believe PTG is the intended reaction to trauma, but as to why the disorder is more common, is for another article.

PTG is a feature that is part of our nature, tucked away in the depths of our mind, encoded in our DNA, to be used as needed, for personal evolution. That is why, in prolonged suffering of cPTSD, does the soul call out. It will sound confusing, faint, like a ghost's whisper, encouraging you to do things radically differently, especially at the start.

> Our minds are powerful emotional processors, capable of tremendous probabilistic calculations for pathing the future of our lives. These calculations are signals, feelings, communicated to us consciously for measured yielding.

That's what happened to me, in the last few months of 2012. I was completely lost and afraid, with no sense of self while surrounded by malignant narcissists, preying on me like vultures. I had been in hell for years, but then I fell down even further after being betrayed by my last best friend. Yet, after losing it all, I became free to clearly see, if only for a short while, but long enough to plan my great escape. The plan would take years to complete, as I would have to learn to believe in myself again, learn to feel again and process my emotions again. I took a leap of faith, but it was the best decision of my life, to start completely over.

# Learn, heal & grow stronger

I began with the radical removal of everyone in my life. It took a few years, but eventually I cut out everyone, with no prejudice, the bad and the good. No going back, no giving up, no surrender. I left myself with one choice and one choice alone, move forward. I needed to figure it out, what I lost, figure out what I needed, figure out what I must do to take care of myself, through and through, no matter what. Eventually, I left the environment of my trauma. I moved far away.

</center>

But that is step one. Cutting out everyone and moving into a new environment. To give myself all the chances I need, to prove to myself that I can take care. To learn it all over again, to feel everything out for myself without the influence of others. And I mean every thing. No rock unturned. No pain unfelt. So I could stand on my own two feet again.

> Some people dislike change, growth, hardship, etc. while holding highly limiting views as to what a human being can do and have the tendency to project that on others. "Misery loves company." But that isn't the real truth, as we human beings have tremendous potential.

    alt="Step 2 - Building strengthening habits"
    width="70%"

</center>

Then comes the training, step two. cPTSD increases sensitivity dramatically. And as much as sensitivity is confused as a weakness, and as overwhelming as it can be, it is a misunderstood super power. Sensitivity is a form of emotinal intelligence that comes from the powerful probabilistic calculator of our subconscious. It can be like an Achilles' heel, but when paired with enough strength and energy, it's an epic capacity for deep perception. It enables reading deeply into others, as if everyone's book opens up to you.

So to harness that power, you must train your body and your mind. Strengthen them until it works for you. Start by minimizing pleasure of the body. You don't need to give up everything, and you don't have to do it all at once, but what softens the mind, depletes the body of its energy. 100%. We need that energy for something more. We must learn to harness it, control it.

> Sensitivity, inner strength & high energy is a power combo

Cold showers, exercise, cooking your food, having a balanced diet, meditation, getting adequate sleep (which will flunctuate as you work through dissociation), sexual abstinence (which is the most energizing habit to have), strengthens the body & boosts energy levels tremendously. Reading books (e.g. philosophy, fiction, whatever your heart feels like reading), writing stories, journaling, learning new subjects like languages, developing social skills like enforcing boundaries, creating new healthy relationships, strengthens the mind. Exploring & spending time in nature resets the Circadian rhythm while giving you time to reacquaint yourself with who you truly are, to learn what works best for you, away from the toxic noise of decrepit systems and subversive cultures. I have spent a highly rewarding year living out of my car, traveling from national park to national park. Give yourself all the space and time to meet yourself, piece by piece. There is no right way to do this, except to listen to yourself, to yeild to the feelings and sensations of the mind, body and heart.

> It is easier and more practical, to master the body before the mind

A lot of social media, TV, movies, games, bar hopping and other parts of popular culture weakens the mind's ability to control focus and discourages belief in oneself. Now, I make an exception for what inspires you, as I have found some movies and music quite helpful but avoid anything & everyone that is pessimistic or has belittling views and values. Frankly, most people just don't have a clue nor the desire or will power to figure it out so don't listen to anyone! That will only prolong the time it takes to heal and grow strong. Learn to identify, on your own, weakening habits and replace them with self-strengthening ones, habit by habit, step by step. This took me the same number of years as it did to fall deeply into darkness.

After strengthening the body and mind, it becomes time for step three, consciously setting your mind's foundation. After freeing your body and mind, you will have the will power to direct your focus.

> Where your focus goes, your energy flows

So focus on believing in yourself, your untapped potential and personal power. Belief is a powerful form of thought, not to be underestimated! Read that again, belief is a powerful form of thought, not to be underestimated. Some types of thought have inner consequences to our mind's structure, affecting personal power. You must take great prudence in what you believe, and who you believe in. Reject poisonous thoughts and accept uplifting ones. Say to yourself, on each belitting intrusive thought, "I reject". It may not work at the start, but eventually it wll. Don't believe in other people, in whatever they have to say, until you believe in yourself, first and foremost. It's okay to be wrong, that's part of the process, but if you don't start believing in yourself, you'll give up your power to others. Do this, step by step, in order to gain your trust. Become familiar with who you truly can be, as you experience glimmers of your light, so you can begin to believe in yourself and the safety you provide.

That is what you go to do. You have to change. You have to harness habits that strengthen you and energize you, and start believing in yourself. This will take your power back, away from those who hurt you. Many people, especially abusers, will hate you for this, they will try to make you fall during this vulnerable period of change, so leave them out (they'll be useful later). But for now, put yourself first. It's way past time for you to be selfish. And you won't have to be selfish forever, just until you reunite with your heart and soul.

> Reignite your mind, body and heart with the light of your soul

After a while, you will learn to recognize & trust your self, and rely on the box that makes feelings, called your heart. Once you find it, pick it up, from the bottom of that dark abyss, and gently, compassionately hug it with all the strengthened love you've developed. It ran away. It's time to convince it that it's safe to stay. Do this over and over again, for every hurt you felt and every hurt you feel. Let that all go.

> This is how we relearn to process our emotions

Forgive yourself of past mistakes. We are all born weak, dependent and highly vulnerable. That is nothing to be ashamed of. It's human. Getting tricked as a kid, or a young adult, or even an old age, it's not something to hold against yourself. Never was. But if you did, that's okay, because you have tremendous potential and personal power. You'll learn to protect your heart and fight for it, with your mind. It's not about having the biggest muscles or being an intimidating hard asshole. It's about having control over your mind, weilding it like a sharp sword, so you can slice down your enemies (ego's), when necessary. So you can feel safe, in your own skin.

> It is through growth that we develop strength, courage & power

You will find pieces of yourself, along the way, frozen in traumatic time. Show each piece patient love and assurance, without judgment, but with strength, admiration and compassion, in the safety of your personal power. You'll grow little by little, every single day. For me, I go and do fun things I enjoyed as a kid, from the time of the trauma, like watching anime movies in cinema. I show these pieces of myself that they are not forgotten. I show them that it is safe to be them, to come home, to assimilate back into the subconscious of being one (again). It takes persistance. And some pieces are going to be very stubborn. There will be set backs, along the way. It's not a straight path, but it's one of the most rewarding things any human being can do. It's the hardest thing I have ever done in my life.

As for the pain, loss, and heart ache, grieve it all. Accept all of it, all that was done, every piece, no matter how ugly. Acceptance is another powerful form of thought. Each time you accept a hidden truth like an egregious set of circumstances, your mind grows taller, you become a bigger person. Things that were tough to handle will seem smaller to you, easier to deal with. Sometimes, you may find a piece of yourself holding back, preventing you from accepting a truth. Work with that piece, learn from it so you can heal it into easing off, into assimilating into your core being, with acceptance.

After a while, maybe months or maybe even years (like in my case), the pain & stress becomes tolerable. You start living a more normal life but triggers remain, inner scars haven't healed and you may feel stuck or resentful about this highly disciplined way of life, like it's not fair. At that point, it's time for the last step.

# Start scoring points

<center>
  <img

</center>

You need to score points, for your team, your side, your self. Psychologists say that the "body keeps the score" and it's absolutely true. But, the buzzer of past trauma didn't go off, the game never ended. That's scary, but a blessing in the long run. Years later, after trauma, after abuse, you can still go back and put points on the score board. As you score more points, you'll transfigure the horrors of (c)PTSD into PTG, piece by piece. This is when the magic happens. This is emotional alchemy.

By this time, you'll have reconnected with yourself, your intuition, and thus understand how to play. The best part is that you'll do it in your own way, on your own terms that maximizes self respect. Do what makes you admire yourself. Listen to your nervous system. It will tell you when and for how long, you can play at a time. You must learn to listen & yeild to the messages of your mind, body and heart. Those feelings, the intuition, the sensitivities, fear, paranoia, all of it is there to guide you, so let it. Listen to it. As you get stronger, as you use score more and more, it gets easier and easier. Healing and growth compounds.

So, once your ready (and you'll know when), reintroduce yourself to that environment with the abusive, miserable people. It can start with a simple, short phone call, a text message. As long as you stand up for yourself, and fight with your mind, following your light. Do not use their tactics, don't score points for the other team! That will confuse your body. It's an easy trap to fall into so focus on scoring for your side, in ways that your proud of. It often is as simple as calmly weilding words that you didn't realize you had, until the moment strikes. Believe in yourself. Believe in your light. Those words are coming from your soul, your light, from who you truly are. Let it flow.

</center>

Ultimately, I can't tell you how to do this part. All I can do is recommend you keep a cool head, and maintain that intimate relationship with yourself, mind, body, heart and soul. You have to be able to listen & yeild to all the messages, the good and the bad. The angel and the demon, that sits on your shoulders. None of that is inherently wrong, it's human. None of that is to be ashamed of. It is all 100% natural.

> Look "Beyond Good and Evil" by Friedrich Nietzsche

Remember, it's not about being nice to mean people or giving them a second chance. It's about being your true, strengthened, proud self, in an environment with abusive people, so you can create new memories that informs the body that the score has changed. That with your developed personal power, you are safe (again). Communicate in your own grown up way for which you cherish and respect. Live by your values. The best effects from fights I've had, were with words that were centered on my values. Only you will know, how you need to do this part. And frankly, you might not consciously know, but that won't matter, as long as you do the other steps first, because by then, you'll be following your higher path that your light shines. It will give you the words to say, and the actions to make.

> Create new memories, informing the body that you are safe in previously deemed dangerous environments and people. That you can now, take care of yourself, because you now know and are capable of fighting for yourself.

For every time you do, you'll score a point for your team and every point you make will convert a piece of cPTSD into PTG. You don't have to it all at once. In fact, don't. It's not a race. It can start with a simple text message. It's your game now, you set the rules. You use the abusers, bullies, and narcissists, again and again and again, as they used you. That's fair. After a while, by putting enough points on the board, making your team the definitive winner, you will have transfigured cPTSD into PTG. You will have emotionally alchemized your pain into your power and in doing so, you will have learnt the true value of being a human being. That's something you can't quite put to words, but it will motivate you for the rest of your life, to live your best life.

# You can do it

This is all very hard to do, trust me, I know. It may take many years, but it **is** possible, it is worth it. There is no due date and no time limit. There is no age too old, no pain too great. It's natural, it's in your DNA. All the answers you need, are found within.

So, get out there, leave that environment and train yourself so one day, you too, can perform emotional alchemy. Save yourself.

Remember, do it in small manageable steps. These life-growing victories compound. It's slow at the start. Don't bother consciously remembering the score, you don't have to think about it, in fact, you'll learn that you don't have to think much anymore. Just learn to listen, let go & yield to the feelings and ways of your mind, body, heart and soul. Don't block your light. It will give you the guidance, you need. It will answer the questions you discover. It is magical.

Fight that darkness. Fight.

> "Rage, rage against the dying of the light." - Dylan Thomas

Get your power back. Your pain is your greatest source of power, not theirs.

The greater the pain, the greater the power, the greater the strength and energy required to weild it.

So don't give up. Don't surrender. I believe in you. And if no one else does, know this, I care.
