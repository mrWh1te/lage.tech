# Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (cPTSD)

cPTSD can be like a living nightmare that you never wake up from. Day in and day out, you struggle with an overwhelming, excruciating, indistinguishable level of stress and pain, emotional flashbacks and night terrors, as it boxes you into survival mode, debilitating choice, with fight, flight, freeze or fawn responses. As time progresses, you slip into the terror of dissociating darkness that can fully captivate you in a form of amnesia. You forget who you are, your likes, your positive feelings like joy or wonder, and even what your face looks like. You no longer recognize the person in the mirror. Eventually, without healing, it becomes normal, eroding all hope for a better tomorrow.

I know this because I had an extreme case of cPTSD. And at its core, was horrific betrayal by parents and closest friends. After falling deeper and deeper for years into what's best described by Dante's Inferno, I ended up alone, broke & broken without awareness of what it was like before.

But, this article isn't about what happened to me. It's about the life changing magic of what I found to do about it. Something you can do yourself.

In my moment of greatest terror, after hitting rock bottom, I fell down from the bottom of hell. I became desparate and radical. But, I made the best choice possible. I began to listen to the subtle whispers from my battered heart. It would take me years before I began to recognize it, I thought it was my ghost for a while. It was severely bruised, like an unkept chimney covered in soot. I was so severely dissociated, for over 10 years that I forgot what it was like to even have a heart, I thought it was all made up like Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny, but thankfully I was wrong. There is a box that makes feelings, but it was missing and in its place was suffocating heart ache, something I referred to as my "black hole".

In answering the calls of my heart, I began to find a way, in steps, to do something that was like a miracle, like magic, but real emotional alchemy.

# Post-Traumatic Growth (PTG)

PTG is the flipped side of the (c)PTSD coin. It's one in the same and you can flip the coin, years later. It's not only possible, but naturally normal, to convert cPTSD into PTG. I believe, it's the intended reaction of our genome, our programming, to trauma, but as to why the disorder is more common, is for another day.

PTG is a feature that is part of our nature, tucked away in the depths of our mind, encoded deeply in our DNA, for personal evolution. That is why, when you're suffering from cPTSD, your betrayed & hurt heart may call out to you, like a confusing, faint whisper of a ghost, encouraging you to do things radically differently, at least at the start.

> Our minds are powerful emotional processors, capable of tremendous probabilistic calculations in pathing the future of our lives. These calculations are signals, feelings, communicated to us consciously for measured yielding.

That's what happened to me, in the last few months of 2012. I was completely lost and afraid, having lost my sense of self completely while surrounded by malignant narcissists, preying on me like vultures. I had been in hell for years, and finally I fell down further after being betrayed by my last friend, but after losing it all, I saw clear as day to make a plan for my great escape. It would take me years later, learning to believe in myself all over again from nothing, before I would succeed in this leap of faith, but it was the best decision of my life. To start completely over and to figure it all out by myself, for myself.

# Learn, heal & grow stronger

I began with radical removal of everyone in my life, cutting out everyone, and even put on a grandoise show to keep myself away from them all. No going back. Only going forward. I needed to figure it out, figure out what I need to stand on my own, to take care of myself, through and through, no matter what.

But that is step one. Cutting out everyone. Going solo, no contact. No chance to learn incorrectly from others. And giving yourself all the chances to learn it all over again correctly, to feel everything out for yourself without others' adulteration. And I mean every little thing. To stand on your own two feet.

> Some people are dislike change, growth, hardship, etc. while holding highly limiting views as to what a human being can do and might project on to you. When the real truth is, people have tremendous potential. They just got to leave that box, that belief system (b.s.).

Then comes the training, step two. cPTSD increases your sensitivity dramatically. And as much as sensitivity is confused as a weakness, and as overwhelming as it is with cPTSD, it is a misused super power. Sensitivity is a form of intelligence part of EQ that is greatly linked with the powerful probabilistic calculations of our subconscious. It can be like an Achilles' heel, but when paired with strength and energy, it's an epic capacity for deep perception. A super power, enabling you to read into people as if you had telepathy.

So, what you need to do is train your body & mind. Strengthen it until your sensitivity works for you. Start by minimizing pleasure. You don't need to give up everything, but alcohol, drugs, sex that is used recreationally, softens the mind and depletes the body of its energy. 100%. It takes a lot of energy to feel great, to be high and for now, we need that energy for something more. We must learn to direct it like our focus.

> Sensitivity, inner strength & energy is a power combo.

A lot of social media, TV, movies, games, and parts of popular culture weakens the mind's focus and discourages belief in self. Now, I make an exception for what inspires you, I found some movies quite helpful but avoid anything & everyone that is pessimistic or has belittling views in human potential (often excuses for themselves), because frankly, most people don't have a fucking clue! Surrounding yourself with weak people, weak idealogies will inhibit you. You must learn to identify weakening habits & replace them with self-strengthening ones, piece by piece, step by step. This took me the same number of years of falling deep into darkness, as it did to crawl out of it.

> It is easier to master the body before the mind.

Cold showers, cardio exercise, cooking your food for a balanced diet, getting adequate sleep (this may increase temporarily as you break through dissociation), sexual abstinence (which is a highly rewarding tough one that I GREATLY recommend), strengthens the body & boosts your energy levels tremendously. Reading books (e.g. philosophy, fiction, whatever your heart feels like reading), writing stories, journaling, learning new subjects like languages, developing boundaries, creating healthy relationships, strengthens the mind. Exploring & spending time in nature resets the Circadian rhythm while giving you time to learn what works best for you, away from the toxicity of decrepit systems and subversive cultures. I have spent a highly rewarding year, so far, living out of my car, traveling from national park to national park, and beyond, roughing it. Giving myself all the space and time to reacquaint myself with who I truly am and I started that towards the end of my healing journey. There is no right way to do this, except to listen to yourself.

The mind's ability to believe is a powerful form of thought, not to be underestimated! Read that again, the mind's ability to believe is a powerful form of thought. Some types of thought have inner consequences to our mind's power. You must take care of what you believe in, and most importantly, who you believe in. Don't believe in other people, in whatever they have to say, until you believe in yourself, first and foremost. It's okay to be wrong, but if you don't start believing in yourself, how will you learn where the wrong is and where the right begins? Find what you need to do, step by step, in order to gain your trust, become familiar with who you trule are so you can believe in your self (again).

That is what you go to do. You must change your way of life, so that your habits strengthen you, energize you into casting your pain as your personal power. Many people, especially abusers, will hate you for this, so leave them out for now (they can be useful later). Put yourself first. It's way past time, for you to be selfish. And you won't have to be selfish forever, just until you reunite with your light.

> Reignite your mind & body with your soul

After a while, you will learn to recognize & trust your self, trust the box that makes feelings, called your heart. Pick it up, from the bottom of your mind, the dark abyss, and gently, softly, compassionately hug it with all the strengthened love you develop. Do this over and over again, for every hurt you felt and every hurt you feel.

> This is how we relearn to process our emotions.

Forgive yourself of past mistakes. We are all born weak, dependent and highly vulnerable. That is nothing to be ashamed of. Getting tricked as a kid, or a young adult, or even an old age, it's not something to hold over yourself. Never was. That's okay, because you have tremendous potential and you'll learn to protect it, fight for it, fight for you. You will learn to fight, with your mind. It's not about having the biggest muscles or being the most intimidating, it's about having control over your mind, weilding it like a sharp sword, capable of slicing down your enemies (ego's).

> It is through growth that we develop strength & courage.

Share with the pieces of you, frozen in traumatic times, patient love, in greater and greater quantities. Show each piece no judgment, but strength, compassion and love, in the safety of your personal power that you'll grow little by little, every single day. For me, I go and do fun things I enjoyed as a kid, from the time of the trauma, like watching anime movies in cinema. I show these pieces of myself that they are not forgotten. I show them that it is safe to come home, to assimilate back into the subconscious of being one (again). It takes persistance. There will be set backs, for it's not a straight path, but it's one of the most rewarding things a person can do.

Grieve all the loss. Accept all of it, every piece, no matter how ugly. Acceptance is another powerful form of thought. Each time you accept a hidden truth like an egregious set of circumstances, your mind grows, you become a bigger person. Things that were tough to handle will seem smaller to you, easier to deal with.

After a while, maybe days, maybe months or maybe even years (like in my case), the pain & stress becomes tolerable, you start living a more normal life but triggers remain, inner scars haven't healed and you may feel stuck or resentful about this highly disciplined way of life. At that point, it's time for the next step.

# Start scoring points

<center>
  <img

    alt="Scoreboard with the home team losing"
    width="50%"

</center>

You need to score points, for your team, for your side, for yourself. Psychologists say that the "body keeps the score" and it's true. But, the buzzer of past trauma doesn't goes off, doesn't end until your 6 feet under. Years later, after trauma, after abuse, you can still put points on the board and with enough points, you'll flip the horror of (c)PTSD into PTG.

It's by winning that game, by putting more points on the board than abusers' team that you'll transfigure cPTSD into PTG. It can come in parts, but this is when the magic happens. This is emotional alchemy.

By this point, you'll have reconnected with yourself, your intuition, and thus know how to play. The best part is that you'll do it your way, on your terms for maximizing self respect. Do it so you admire yourself. Listen to your nervous system. It will tell you when and for how long, you can play at a time. You must learn to listen & yeild to the messages of your mind, body and heart. Those feelings, the intuition, the sensitivities, fear, paranoia, all of it. As you get stronger, as you use score more and more, it gets easier and easier. It compounds.

So, once your ready (and you'll know when, your body might drive you here), reintroduce yourself to environments with abusive people. Maybe start with a phone call. But, stand up for yourself, and fight with your mind, using your tactics. Don't use their tactics, don't score for the other team! It's an easy trap to fall into so focus on scoring for your's and everyone else on your side, in a way you'll be proud of. It often is as simple as calmly weilding words that you didn't realize until then that you have.

</center>

Ultimately, I can't tell you how to do this part, but I recommend keeping a cool head. You have to do the work, develop that relationship with yourself, your mind, body and heart. You have to be able to listen & yeild to it all, the good and the bad. The angel and the demon, on your shoulders. None of that is inherently wrong, it's simply human. None of that is to be ashamed of. It is all natural.

> Look "Beyond Good and Evil" by Friedrich Nietzsche

It's not about being nice to abusive people or giving them a second chance. It's about being your true, strengthened, proud self, in an environment with abusive people so you can create new memories that informs the body that the score has changed. That you developed your personal power, and it keeps you safe. Communicate in your grown up way that you respect & cherish. Only you will know, how you need to do this part. And frankly, you might not consciously know, but it won't matter, if you do the other steps because you'll be following your higher path that your heart leads. It will tell you the way, it will give you the words to say, the actions to make.

> Create new memories, informing the body that you are safe in previously deemed dangerous environments. That you are safe around evil people. That you can now, take care of yourself, because you can fight for yourself.

For every time you do, you'll score a point for your team. You don't have to it all at once. It's not a race. It can start with a simple brief phone call. But then it becomes your game and you will use abusers, bullies, evil people, again and again and again, as they used you. It's only fair. Thus, by putting enough points on the board, making your team the definitive winning team, you will have transfigured cPTSD into PTG. You will have emotionally alchemized your pain into your power and in doing so, you will have learnt what it truly means to be a human being. Something you can't quite put to words, but it will motivate you for the rest of your life.

# You can do it

This is all very hard to do, and may take many years, but it **is** possible. There is no expiration date, there is no age too old, no pain too big, to do this. It's in your DNA. The answers are found within.

So, get out there, leave that environment and train yourself so one day, you can perform emotional magic.

Do it in small manageable steps, compound life-growing victories. Don't bother consciously remembering the score, you don't have to think about it, just learn to listen, let go & yield too the signals of your mind, body & heart. They'll give you all the guidance, you'll need. They'll answer all the questions you discover.

Fight that darkness.

Your pain is your greatest source of power. So flip it.

The greater the pain, the greater the power.

Don't give up. I believe in you.
