# Iterative Development Loop

People in tech are familiar with the classic *iterative* process of developing new features and fixing bugs: develop code, deploy to a testing environment (i.e. Staging), collect feedback, then repeat.

</center>

This process has been proven thorough enough that it consistently delivers satisfactory results.

Now, with the emergence of powerful Documentation tools, from [Docz](https://www.docz.site/) to [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), comes an opportunity for frontend teams to revise this process, to shorten the loop, by reducing the length of the development leg.

# UI First Development

Traditionally, developers build out the complete feature for review on each iteration. If you're using React or Angular, you're probably splitting components into Smart and UI components like such:

</center>

The UI first development approach has developers focusing on the UI layer of component code first, iterating on that portion of the frontend code first, until the UX/UI is satisfactory from all stake holders, before ever writing a single line of business logic, in the smart layer of component code.

Traditionally, the develop portion of the iterative process has frontend developers building out both the smart business logic and UI code. That's two separate layers of code. To calculate the number of layers of code being iterated per feature or bug, we can use Big-O notation and attribute it as such:

<center>2n</center>

For every feature or bug, you will develop it 2n times, because you may potentially rewrite the smart layer and UI layer on each iteration.

This is opposed to the UI first development approach, where teams iterate on *just* the UI components before writing a single Smart component. We can represent the number of iterations in code layers with such:

<center>n + 1</center>

That's because, now with tools like Storybook, teams can iterate on the UI portion of their components first, and only that, until the UI/UX are satisfactory, and upon which, can have the developers write the smart business portion of the component code, once.

## 2n > n+1 Development Speed

n + 1 is shorter than 2n so, more often than not, this process will take less time to complete new features and fix old bugs.

Let's say it takes 4 iterations to build a new feature correctly, like a blog post viewer. Traditionally, you may write up to 2n -> 2(4) = 8 iterations of component code. If you use UI first development, it's n+1 -> (4)+1 = 5.

Therefore, the number of working hours to complete a new feature, will on average, take less time and therefore cost less, or for the same hours of cost, the throughput of work increases. Depending on how you want to look at it.

In this example, you might save from 8 to 16 hours of developer time. For just one new feature.

## How many features did you deliver last year?
