# Web Application Development

Tech has grown a lot over recent years. Almost every industry has invested countless resources into adopting and building their own applications to stay relevant in our fast digital world.

Web app development has evolved into a highly detailed, iterative process, that aims to build intuitive solutions for dynamic problems. Even with the strongest grasp of the problems' needs, it's almost impossible to visualize a robust, intuitive solution, in completion. It takes domain expertise from design, product, development, management, to build intuitive applications that works wonders for the users, but also for those working on it.

Many app developments follow Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It breaks down a solution's idea into unique behaviors, like features or parts of features. Each behavior is assigned a user-story, or stories, summarizing the segment of work.

As the behavior is developed, there is a review process, often leading to an iterative approach, in refining the behavior. It may look like this:

--IMAGE--
Business -> Product -> Design -> Develop -> Deploy -> Testing -> Review -> Iterate

Business defines the focus of the problem, to its greatest impact. Product works with business in creating a simple solution. Design creates UX and UI mocks of the solution. Finally, developers bring it to life, and begin the iterative process, which repeats itself `n` times until approved.

It's a thorough process that collaborates effort from multiple domains into one great solution. 

# UI first Development

There is a popular coding pattern, in many Single Page Applications, of splitting components into two layers: smart and UI. The smart component handles the business logic, like providing data from an API, to handling events like submitting a form. The UI component handles the UI, with an interface for smart components to integrate.

The pattern has great benefits like optimizing web app performance, separating concerns for more maintainable code. It also works great with the UI first Development approach.

The UI first Development approach optimizes the iterative process in the Develop stage, by delaying all the smart logic, both backend & frontend, until the UI portion of the feature is complete. Therefore, if during the iterative process, major changes were to happen, as new information is discovered, there is less code to rewrite. This is extremely beneficial for exploring novel concepts with experimental features.

This all comes together with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). You code the UI component, as usual, then using [Component Story Format](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf), you display the UI component for the various stories of the feature. For each behavior, a story can exist, organized under each feature in your app's Storybook.

# Storybook

Storybook makes it really easy to demonstrate your UI components, with interactive knobs, actions, events, documentation and more. It has an easy CLI, that with one command, can get a Storybook app running, in addition to your app, for popular JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, Angular and so forth. It handles all the work for the app, so developers can focus on building interactive stories for their UI components.

My open-source Enterprise example Angular app called [ngLibrary](https://github.com/mrWh1te/ngLibrary) ([demo](https://nglibrary-demo.netlify.com/)), has an online [Storybook](https://nglibrary-demo.netlify.com/storybook) for displaying all its components with various states. There was no need to mock an API response, but instead use knobs to plug in data to the UI component to test how the component displays for each edge case.

### Easy to interface Inputs/Outputs

### Storybook plugins

Speaking hypothetically, what if the design team or product team were unsure of the UI like the color of the button's font? Developers can use the helpful `knobs` plugin, to interface with an Angular's UI component's Inputs!
