# Agricultural revolution

"Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari, insightfully explores facets of the Agricultural Revolution. It began roughly 12,000 years ago. It was game-changing innovation - that happened across the world. The way of life for our ancestors changed. In some ways good, and in some ways bad.

Thanks to an increase food supply, human beings were able to make more human beings. Populations proliferated. Villages became safer as the numbers of people increased. However, there came costs. Diversity in nutrition diminished greatly, as diets began to focus on single sources of (more) food instead of foraging across distant lands. And, there was the back breaking work of farming and herding.

Wheat, a popular crop, benefitted greatly from this revolution. It proliferated across the planet, along the growth of human beings, but without doing any new work. Thus, it's arguable, that in the Agricultural Revolution, it was not human beings that domesticated wheat, but wheat... that domesticated human beings.

All of the above, is from that book, in the fifth chapter. Great read.

Now, let's take a moment, and consider a parallel, between wheat, in the Agricultural Revolution, and the world's system, today.

# The system

From across all the conspiracy theories, such as the rich taking over, puppet master families controlling things, to power games and what have you, there's a growing possibility that things are out of our control.

Today, in our vastly complicated system, comprised of subsystems in politics, economics, social, and so forth, moving very fast. It's all in flow. On paths, structured, by human beings, who have iteratively created and maintained the system. And for centuries now, things have been going, building, becoming, real, in the way that the system, through us, has become it's own thing, with a lot of momentum.

But, the system is not alive. It's not divine. It does not have any capacities to feel, to grow, like you and me. However, to stabilize economics, to stabilize world order, for future prosperity; for whatever causes, forces at play have worked to strengthen the system. More and more, consolidating, while human beings in first world countries grow more and more dependent on it.

It's possible that in recent times, that our relationship with the system, as maintainers, in choosing it's (and inevitably our's) path, has flipped - that the system itself now maintains us, on this path. From rich to poor. Anyone living in the system, cannot avoid its structure, its ruling, its viewpoints, as laid out in its path of precedents.

# Wheat

So perhaps, things seem the way they are, not because some group or conspiracy is behind it all, but maybe because the relationship we think we have, with the very system we created and maintained; has completely changed. That we are no longer the choosers in our destines but surfers of an old wave.

That now, the system is like wheat. Spreading and benefitting from our "back breaking work", while it keeps us in line.

Like fucking wheat.
