# Agricultural revolution

Popular book "Sapiens", by Yuval Noah Harari, insightfully explores the Agricultural Revolution. In brief, it began roughly 12,000 years ago and it was life-changing innovation - that happened across the world. Some of its effects were good, and some bad.

For starters, there was an increase in the food supply, so human beings were able too... drum roll please... make more human beings! Populations proliferated. Human beings settled down. Villages grew, and those boundaries created security. However, there came costs.

Diversity in nutrition diminished greatly, as diets no longer consisted of foraging across distant lands, as foragers became farmers. Crops like wheat were domesticated during the revolution. A process of farming was developed and refined.

Wheat proliferated across the planet by riding on the coat tails of human innovation and work. It benefitted, without doing any additional work, itself! Thus, one can argue, that during the Agricultural Revolution, it wasn't human beings that domesticated wheat, but really, it was wheat that domesticated human beings. Simply because, we're doing the back-breaking work, while its DNA expontentially spreads across the planet.

Now, all of the above, is from the fifth chapter of that book, none of it's new. Great read.

So, let's take a moment, and consider a parallel, between the relationship between humans and wheat, during the Agricultural Revolution, and the relationship between humans and the world's system, today.

# The system

From across all the conspiracy theories on who (or whom) controls the world, such as the rich taking over, China/Russia, puppet masters, families controlling the system, or what have you, there's a growing possibility that things are really in no one's or group's control. In other words, no human or humans control it nor will ever again.

That these days, in our vastly complicated, massive system, moving forward at a (still) growingly difficult to keep-up pace. It has serious momentum. That perhaps it has outgrown our ability to control.

You see, we have an implicit relationship with our system, because not only did we create it for order, we depend on it to maintain order, like young children with their parents and teachers. The relationship we have between the system itself and us, holds us to what we created, in order to provide stability, security and hopefully prosperity. It's made of sub-systems from culture to politics and economics. Some of it changes fast eg technology & culture, while some of it changes very slow eg politics and law. Collectively, it guides us, by holding us to what we set, on a linear path forward, maintaining order & stability.

For centuries now, things have been in motion, building up momentum, defining more rigid structure, becoming in a way real that the system, through us, has perhaps become as real or bigger than us, an entity that must be kept alive, even though it has no breath to breath. As we depend on it to breath.

But, the system is not alive. It's not divine. It does not have any capacities to feel, to grow, like you or me. It does not empthatize nor conceptualize what is happening around the world. It's vulnerable, in its own way. It's foundational economic layers are pretty slow to change. Thus, when crisis emerges from unknown causes, the solution tends to be reactive, based on precedents, in repeatingly strengthening the system eg consolidating banks that are too big to fail.

To stabilize economics, to stabilize world order, for future prosperity or whatever causes claimed, more and more, consolidating, making it bigger and bigger to the point that perhaps no human or humans can truly, with tools, conceive it in a given moment to actually control it, to actually influence destiny, that destiny itself has now become set - through this marriage of human beings and the system we created.

Thus, it's possible that in recent times, given our relationship with the system, and how things are, that we are no longer the choosers of it's (and inevitably our's) path any longer that the system itself, in our dependent entangled relationship with it, keeps its and inevitably our paths set linearly forward. From rich to poor. From powerful to weak. All those who attempt to live, to exist with, essentially interface the system, cannot avoid its structures, rules, or firmly held viewpoints, as laid out on its path of proven precedents.

# Wheat

So perhaps, things may seem secretly controlled by some invisible mastermind(s) - all powerful - all seeing entity, but really that's not the case because the very system itself, that we created and maintain, now implicitly controls us, in a state of reduced optionality. That through our relationship with it, like children to parents, we no longer choose our destinies but at best, have our destinies set, for the forseeable future, as we ride along the path that the system so diligently keeps us too.

So like the farmers, during the Agricultural Revolution, benefitted from the back-breaking work of domesticating wheat, the very benefits of it, are exposed to the dependency upon it. That, things have become so massive, that the populations of wheat and human grow so big, that we have no other choice but to stay on path with it.

The system like fucking wheat could very well be domesticating us now and for the forseeable future.
