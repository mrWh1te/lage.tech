excerpt: A meta parallel between wheat, post Agricultural Revolution, and the system today

# Agricultural revolution

The New York Times bestseller "Sapiens", written by Yuval Noah Harari, insightfully explores the Agricultural Revolution. In brief, it began roughly 12,000 years ago. It changed the path of human life across the world. Nomadic foragers settled down as farmers. Its effects were good, but also bad.

For starters, there was an increase in the food supply, so human beings were able too... drum roll please... make more human beings! Populations proliferated. Villages grew, and with those larger consolidated numbers of people, came greater security against perceivable threats.

However, the diversity in human nutrition diminished greatly, as diets no longer consisted of varied food sources across distant lands. Instead, diets focused on a few species and crops, as the process of farming was discovered and refined, we grew along specific species, domesticating them in the relationships we build with them.

In particular consideration, wheat was a popular crop of choice that proliferated across the planet, benefitting greatly from this revolution. It achieved this without doing any additional work, itself! It did not change, it didn't develop tools, it simply kept on as it was, now spreading further with security by being farmed. As human populations grew, wheat became a necessity for feeding all those additional mouths, to maintain order. Thus, one can at least joke, if not argue, that after the Agricultural Revolution, it wasn't human beings that domesticated wheat, but really, it was wheat that domesticated human beings. Because, we're doing all the back-breaking work, growing dependent on it while it experiences abundance of proliferation, and security of its evolution, all paid for by human beings, across the world.

Now, all of the above, is from the fifth chapter in the aforementioned book, none of it's new. Absolutely fantastic read. I recommend it.

But, let's take a moment, and consider a parallel, between the described relationship of humans and wheat, post Agricultural Revolution, and the relationship between humans and our created system, as it exists today.

# Control of the system

From across all the conspiracy theories on who controls (or attempts to) the system, such as Bill Gates, China/Russia, puppet master families, terrorists or what have you, there's a growing possibility that it's no longer possibile to truly, deeply, impactfully, really control the system anymore. In other words, no human or humans can control it now, nor may ever be able to again.

That these days, in our vastly complicated, massive system, moving forward at a (still) growingly difficult to keep-up pace that it has simply outgrown our ability to control, to truly change course, in ways we once had, as we are presently dwarfed by size (complexity) and momentum.

You see, we have an implicit & dependent relationship with our system, because not only did we create it for order, but we need it to maintain order, like parents in homes for growing children. The relationship we have between the system itself and us, holds us to what we standardize, as a necessity in order to provide stability, security and hopefully prosperity. But, the system is vastly complicated, made up of a multitude of sub-systems diverse in richness from culture to politics and even economics. Some of it changes fast like culture and technology, while some of it changes slow like law and economics. Yet, collectively, it guides us upon a path, by a form of marriage.

For centuries now, things have been in motion, building up momentum, collecting innovations, defining more rigid structures, becoming in a way real, metaphysically that the system, through us, has has even grown bigger than our collective species, an entity that we keep going, keep alive, even though it has no breath to breath. Because, we depend on it, to secure our breath for life.

However, the system is not alive. It's not divine. It does not have any capacities to feel, grow, like you or me. It does not empthatize nor conceptualize what is happening around the world. It does not understand. In its own way, it stands vulnerable. It's foundational layers like law and economics are slow to change. Thus, when crisis emerges from unknown or misunderstood causes, the solution tends to be the samething that works in the past, a reactive, precedent proven, strengthening of the system, in ways such as consolidating banks that are too big to fail. Dedicating more available resources to surfaces of the system that expose us to great risk in security of order.

To stabilize economics, to protect peace, for future prosperity or whatever causes claim, more and more, the system gets bigger and stronger, in its set ways, to the point that perhaps no human or humans can truly, even with advanced tools, conceive it in its entirety, in order to affect true control, to actually influence our shared path, even destiny, that fate itself has now become set - through this marriage of human beings and this, so well defined yet so complicated of a system, holds us too.

Thus, it's possible that in recent times, given our relationship with the system, and how things are, that we no longer can choose major change, as the system itself, in our entangled state with it, keeps its and inevitably our paths set, linearly forward, without significant changing. From rich to poor. From powerful to weak. All those who attempt to live, to exist with, essentially interface the system, and thus cannot avoid its structures, rules, and firmly held viewpoints, as laid out on its path of proven precedent.

We are married to it, for better or worse, until death do us part.

# Wheat

So perhaps, things may seem secretly in control by some all powerful mastermind(s), or all seeing entity, because maybe, it is in a way, but it's not human. That really the very system itself, that we once created and now maintain, metaphysically, implicitly controls us, in a state of dependent, reduced optionality, rigidly protected by collective precedent.

That even through each other, we do the work of the system, in reminding each other, reminding ourselves, to be held to the standards of the system. We defend the system because deep down, we feel utterly fragile without it, naked & alone in a cold dark alley.

That like wheat, after the Agricultural Revolution, the system holds human beings to a path that is both ordered (good for security) and exposed to risks of stagnation (security tail risk).

The system and our relationship with it has become so massive, like the populations of wheat and human growing so big and dependent, that we have no other choice but to stick with it, even if it prevents us from fixing things. It could take a major crisis to open the door for significant change.

That the system is like wheat, holding us in a box, domesticating us, keeping us in check like fences for cattle, working land like working jobs, as we intended, but unchanging thus vulnerable to what we don't know or misunderstand.

Fucking wheat.
