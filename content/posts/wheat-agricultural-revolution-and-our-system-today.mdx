# Agricultural revolution

A fantastic read, "Homo Sapiens" refers to the Agricultural Revolution of having occured 12-20,000 years ago. It was a game-changing innovation - across the world. The way of life for our ancestors changed. In some ways good, and in some ways bad.

Thanks to a stable food supply, human beings were able to make more human beings. We proliferated - across the world. But, not all things were great. The daily nutrition diminished in diversity, as we settled down to tend our crop, we no longer ate from various environments. Also, human beings' backs are not designed for leaning over all day, tending to crops. It's called "back breaking work", for a reason. However, it became an acceptable sacrifice for bigger families, villages and communities.

Wheat benefitted from this revolution, particularly well. It proliferated across the planet, along the growth of human beings, but without doing any new work. Thus, one can argue, that in the Agricultural Revolution, it was not human beings that domesticated wheat, but wheat... that domesticated human beings.

All of the above, is from that book, in the first few chapters.

Now, take a moment, and consider the parallel, between wheat and the world's system.

# The system

From across all the conspiracy theories, such as the rich taking over, puppet master families controlling things, etc etc; there's a growing possibility that there's really no conspiracy at all.

Today, in our vastly complicated system of subsystems existing within popular domains such as politics, economics, social... It's all composed of stuff that is in flow. On paths, structured, such as you and I. And for centuries now, things have been going, building, a lot of momentum.

It's possible that in recent decades, as often as success does, that human beings have grown vulnerable, and more dependent on this system.

The system is not alive. It does not have any capacities to feel, to grow, like you and me. However, to stabilize economics, to stabilize world order, for future prosperity and growth, forces at play have strengthened the system. More and more, consolidating, while human beings in first world countries grow more and more in need of it.

One can argue, that we are no longer the maintainers of the system, choosing it's path, but flipped - that the system itself now maintains us, on this path. From rich to poor. Anyone living in the system, cannot avoid its structure, laid out in its path.

# Wheat

So perhaps, things seem the way they are, not because some group or conspiracy is behind it all, but maybe because the relationship we think we have, with the very system we created and maintained; has flipped.

That now, the system is like wheat. Spreading and benefitting from our "back breaking work"...

Fucking wheat.
