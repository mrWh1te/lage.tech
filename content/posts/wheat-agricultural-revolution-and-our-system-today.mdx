# Agricultural revolution

"Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari, insightfully explores the Agricultural Revolution in Chapter 5. In brief, it began roughly 12,000 years ago and it was life-changing innovation - that happened across the world. Some of its effects were good, and some bad.

For starters, there was an increase to the food supply, so human beings were able to make more human beings. Populations proliferated. Human beings settled down. Villages grew, and the rise in population brought safety. However, there came costs.

Diversity in nutrition diminished greatly, as diets no longer consisted of diverse foraging across distant lands. Foragers became farmers. And crops like wheat were domesticated in the process.

Wheat proliferated across the planet during this revolution. It did so on the back-breaking work of our ancestors, without doing any additional work, itself! Thus, one can argue, that during the Agricultural Revolution, it wasn't human beings that domesticated wheat, but really, it was wheat that domesticated human beings.

All of the above, is from that book, in the fifth chapter. Great read.

Now, let's take a moment, and consider a parallel, between wheat, in the Agricultural Revolution, and the world's system, today.

# The system

From across all the conspiracy theories on who (or whom) controls the world, such as the rich taking over, puppet master families controlling the system, or what have you, there's a growing possibility that things are really in no one's or group's control, nor will ever be again.

That these days, in our vastly complicated system, moving forward at a (still) growingly difficult to keep-up pace. That it has outgrown our ability to choose, in a way, where it now holds us, to a path that we once had collectively set.

You see, we have an implicit relationship with our system, because not only did we create it for order, we depend on it to maintain order, like young children with their parents. The relationship we have between the system itself and us, guides us on a linear path forward, which is part of how it maintains order.

It, with us, are in flow. On paths, structured, once by us, who created and (still) maintain the system. And for centuries now, things have been going, building, becoming, real, in the way that the system, through us, has perhaps become as real or bigger than us, in our need and momentum of our lives.

But, the system is not alive. It's not divine. It does not have any capacities to feel, to grow, like you or me. It does not empthatize nor conceptualize what is happening. It's vulnerable, in its own way. For example, it's pretty slow to change. Thus, when crisis has emerged from unknown causes, the solution tends to focus on strengthening the system, to stabilize economics, to stabilize world order, for future prosperity or whatever causes claimed. More and more, consolidating, making it bigger, too big to fail, while human beings, such as those in first world countries, have grown more and more dependent on it. Smaller. And fragile.

Thus, it's possible that in recent times, given our relationship with the system, and how things are, that we are no longer the choosers of it's (and inevitably our's) path that the system itself, in our dependent entangled relationship with it, keeps its and inevitably our paths forward. From rich to poor. Anyone living in the system, trying to thrive, elevate class, cannot avoid its structure, its rules, its viewpoints, as laid out on its path of proven precedents.

# Wheat

So perhaps, things seem secretly controlled by some invisible mastermind(s), not because some group or conspiracy is behind it all, but maybe because the very system itself, that we created and maintain, now implicitly controls us, through the state of reduce optionality. That through our relationship with it, like children to parents, we no longer choose our destines but at best, ride along the path the system and us are on.

That now, the system is like wheat. Spreading and benefitting from our "back breaking work", while it keeps us in line, without doing any new work itself, for us.

Like fucking wheat.
