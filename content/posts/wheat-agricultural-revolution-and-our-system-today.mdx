excerpt: A meta parallel between wheat, post Agricultural Revolution, and the system today

# Agricultural revolution

The New York Times bestseller "Sapiens", written by Yuval Noah Harari, insightfully explores the Agricultural Revolution. In brief, it began roughly 12,000 years ago. It changed the path of human life across the world. Nomadic foragers settled down to become farmers. Its effects were good, but also bad.

For starters, there was an increase in the food supply, so human beings were able too... drum roll please... make more human beings! Populations proliferated. Villages grew, and with those larger consolidated numbers of people, came greater security against perceivable threats.

However, the diversity in human nutrition diminished greatly, as diets no longer consisted of varied food sources across distant lands. Instead, diets focused on a few species and crops, in developing the process of farming, we grew along chosen species & crops, domesticating them via the relationships we built with them.

In particular consideration, wheat was a popular crop of choice that proliferated across the planet, benefitting greatly from this revolution. It achieved this without doing any additional work! It did not change, it didn't develop tools, it simply kept on as it was, now spreading further with security of being taken care of by farmers. As human populations grew, wheat became a requirement for feeding all those additional mouths. Thus, one can at least joke, if not argue, that during the Agricultural Revolution, it wasn't human beings that domesticated wheat, but really, it was wheat that domesticated human beings. Because, we're doing all the back-breaking work, while growing dependent on it, yet it experiences an abundance of life, and security in its evolution, all paid for by human beings, across the world.

Now, all of the above, is from the fifth chapter in the aforementioned book, none of it's new. Absolute fantastic read. I recommend it.

But, let's take a moment, and consider a parallel, between the described relationship of humans and wheat, post Agricultural Revolution, and the relationship between humans and our created system, as it exists today.

# Control of the system

These days, there are conspiracy theories on who controls (or attempts to control) the system, such as Bill Gates, China/Russia, puppet master families, terrorists or what have you, but there's a growing possibility that it's no longer feasible to truly control the system and human beings, anymore. In other words, no human or humans can change it now, nor may ever be able to again.

That these days, in our vastly complicated, massive system, moving forward at a (still) increasingly difficult to keep-up pace that it has simply outgrown our ability to control, to truly change course, in ways we once had, as we are dwarfed by its size (complexity) and momentum.

You see, we have an implicit & dependent relationship with our system, because not only did we create it for order, but we require it to maintain order, like parents in homes for growing children. The relationship we have between the system itself and us, holds us to what we have standardized, as a necessity in order to provide stability, security and hopefully prosperity. But, the system is vastly complicated, made up of a multitude of sub-systems, diverse in richness from culture to politics and even economics. Some of it changes fast like culture and technology, while some of it changes slow like law and economics. Yet, collectively, it guides us upon a path, via a form of marriage.

For centuries now, things have been in motion, building up momentum, collecting innovations, defining more rigid structures, becoming in a way real, metaphysically that the system, through us, has has even grown bigger than our collective species, an entity that we keep going, we keep alive, even though it has no breath to breath. Because, we depend on it, to secure our breath of life.

However, the system is not alive. It's not divine. It does not have any capacities to feel, grow, like you or me. It does not empthatize nor conceptualize what is happening around the world. It does not understand. In its own way, it stands vulnerable, like a child. It's foundational layers like law and economics are slow to change. Thus, when crisis emerges from unknown or misunderstood causes, the solution tends to be the same, a reactive, precedent proven, further strengthening of the system in ways such as, consolidating banks that are too big to fail. Dedicating more available resources to surfaces of the system that expose us to great risk.

To stabilize economics, to protect peace, for future prosperity or whatever causes claim, more and more, the system gets bigger and stronger, in its set ways, to the point that perhaps no human or humans can truly, even with advanced tools, conceive it in its entirety, in order to affect true change, through true control, to actually influence our shared path in a major way, even destiny, that fate itself has now become set - through this marriage of human beings and this, so well defined yet so complicated of a system.

Thus, it's possible that in recent times, given our relationship with the system, and how things are moving, that we no longer can choose major change, as the system itself, in our entangled state with it, keeps its and inevitably our paths set, linearly forward. From rich to poor. From powerful to weak. All those who attempt to live, to exist with, essentially interface the system, and thus cannot avoid its structures, rules, and firmly held viewpoints, as laid out on its path of proven precedent.

We are married to it, for better or worse, until death do us part.

# Wheat

So perhaps, things are in control by a unalive, metaphysical entity. That really the very system itself, that we once created and now maintain, metaphysically, implicitly controls us, in a state of dependent, reduced optionality, rigidly protected by collective precedent.

That even through each other, we do the work of the system, in reminding each other, reminding ourselves, to be held to the standards of the system. We defend the system because deep down, we feel utterly fragile without it, naked & alone in a dark cold alley.

That like wheat, after the Agricultural Revolution, the system holds human beings to a path that is both ordered (good for security) and exposed to new risks like dependencies and over consolidation.

The system and our relationship with it has become so massive, like the populations of human and wheat growing so big, that we have no other choice but to stick with it, even if it prevents us from fixing things - as needed, because it's the safer, more sensible choice. It could take a major crisis to open the door for significant change.

That the system is like wheat, boxing us in to what has become, domesticating us, keeping us in check like fences for cattle by having us work the lands like working jobs, yet as we intended, unchanging, and now more vulnerable to what we don't know or misunderstand.

That what controls us now is like wheat - it has no feelings, no intelligence, it just is how it is, thanks to us.

Like fucking wheat.
