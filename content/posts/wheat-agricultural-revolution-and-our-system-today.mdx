# Agricultural revolution

A fantastic read, "Homo Sapiens" refers to the Agricultural Revolution of having occured 12-20,000 years ago. It was game-changing innovation. The way of life for our ancestors changed. Some good, some bad.

Thanks to the proliferation of a stable food supply, human beings were able to make more human beings. The daily nutrition diminished in diversity, as we settled down to tend the crop. Unfortunately, human beings' backs are not designed for leaning over all day, tending to crops. This "back breaking work" became an acceptable sacrifice for bigger families, villages and communities.

Wheat benefitted from this revolution, particularly well. It proliferated across the planet with the growth of human beings, but without doing any of the work. Thus, one can argue, that it was not human beings that domesticated wheat, but wheat that domesticated human beings.

All of the above, is from the book, in the first chapter. What I want to draw upon you today, is that there may be a striking similarity between wheat and the world's system.

# The system

Across all the conspiracy theories of the rich taking over, or puppet masters making the system worse for their benefit, there's a growing possibility that there's no conspiracy at all.

Today, in our vastly complicated system of subsystems within popular domains such as political, economic, social... Things in this stuff are in flow. They are on paths, such as you and I. And for centuries now. There is a lot of momentum, built up.

It's possible that in recent decades, as often as success does, that we've grown vulnerable, dependent. And the system is not alive. It does not have any capacities to feel, to grow, like you and me. However, to stabilize economics, we've strengthened the system. More and more while growing more and more in need of it.

It's possible that we are no longer the creators and maintainers of it, but it is now the maintainer and driver us. From rich to poor. No one can avoid it.

# Wheat

So perhaps, things have gotten worse, not because some group or conspiracy is bringing down the world, but because the relationship we have with our very own system has flipped.

That now, the system is like wheat. Spreading, benefitting from our "back breaking work".

Fucking wheat.
