# Agricultural revolution

"Sapiens A Brief History of Humankind" by Yuval Noah Harari, insightfully explores the Agricultural Revolution in Chapter 5. In brief, it began roughly 12,000 years ago and it was life-changing innovation - that happened across the world. Some of its effects were good, and some bad.

For starters, there was an increase to the food supply, so human beings were able to make more human beings. Populations proliferated. Human beings settled down. Villages grew, and the rise in population brought safety. However, there came costs.

Diversity in nutrition diminished greatly, as diets no longer consisted of diverse foraging across distant lands. Foragers became farmers. And crops like wheat were domesticated in the process.

Wheat proliferated across the planet during this revolution. It did so on the back-breaking work of our ancestors, without doing any additional work, itself! Thus, one can argue, that during the Agricultural Revolution, it wasn't human beings that domesticated wheat, but really, it was wheat that domesticated human beings.

All of the above, is from that book, in the fifth chapter. Great read.

Now, let's take a moment, and consider a parallel, between wheat, in the Agricultural Revolution, and the world's system, today.

# The system

From across all the conspiracy theories, such as the rich taking over, puppet master families controlling the system, or whatever have you, there's a growing possibility that things are in no one's or group's control, and ever will be.

That these days, in our vastly complicated system, moving forward at growingly difficult to keep-up with pace. That it has outgrown our ability to maintain, in a way, where it now holds us, to the path that we once, collectively set.

We have an implicit relationship with the system, because we depend on it for important resources and order, like children with their parents. It's made up of systems such as politics, economics, culture and so forth. All these things, through the relationships with us, guides us on a linear path forward.

It's all in flow. On paths, structured, once by us, whom created and maintain the system. And for centuries now, things have been going, building, becoming, real, in the way that the system, through us, has become bigger than us, with a lot of momentum too boot.

But, the system is not alive. It's not divine. It does not have any capacities to feel, to grow, like you and me. It's pretty slow at change. However, to stabilize economics, to stabilize world order, for future prosperity; for whatever causes, forces at play have worked to strengthen the system. More and more, consolidating, making it bigger, too big to fail, while human beings, such as those in first world countries, have grown more and more dependent on it. Fragile.

Thus, it's possible that in recent decades, that our relationship with the system, as choosers, in choosing it's (and inevitably our's) path, has flipped - that the system itself now chooses its and inevitably our paths. From rich to poor. Anyone living in the system, cannot avoid its structure, its ruling, its viewpoints, as laid out on its path of proven precedents.

# Wheat

So perhaps, things seem secretly controlled by some invisible mastermind(s), not because some group or conspiracy is behind it all, but maybe because the very system itself, that we created and maintain, controls us. That through our relationship with it, like children to parents, we no longer choose our destines but at best, ride the coat tails of system that remains in flight.

That now, the system is like wheat. Spreading and benefitting from our "back breaking work", while it keeps us in line, without doing any additional work itself.

Like fucking wheat.
