# Agricultural revolution

The New York Times Bestseller "Sapiens", written by Yuval Noah Harari, insightfully explores the Agricultural Revolution. In brief, it began roughly 12,000 years ago. It changed the path of human life across the world. Nomadic foragers settled down as farmers. Its effects were good, but also bad.

For starters, there was an increase in the food supply, so human beings were able too... drum roll please... make more human beings! Populations proliferated. Villages grew, and with those larger numbers, came greater security.

However, the diversity in human nutrition diminished greatly, as diets no longer consisted of varied food sources, across distant lands. Instead, diets focused on species we could herd, and crops that we domesticated, as the process of farming was discovered and refined.

In particular, wheat proliferated across the planet, benefitting greatly from this revolution, as a major farmable crop. And, it received this without doing any additional work, itself! It did not change, it simply was farmed and as human populations grew, became a necessity for order, by sustaining the new bigger population numbers. Thus, one can at least joke, if not argue, that during the Agricultural Revolution, it wasn't human beings that domesticated wheat, but really, it was wheat that domesticated human beings. Because, we're doing all the back-breaking work, dependent on it while it experiences abundance and proliferation of its own species in its, now secured path of evolution, supported by human beings, across the world.

Now, all of the above, is from the fifth chapter in the aforementioned book, none of it's new. Absolutely fantastic read. I recommend it.

But, let's take a moment, and consider a parallel, between the described relationship between humans and wheat, post Agricultural Revolution, and the relationship between humans and the our created system, today.

# Control of the system

From across all the conspiracy theories on who (or whom) controls the system, such as the rich, China/Russia, puppet master families, terrorists or what have you, there's a growing possibility that no longer exists the possibilty to truly, deeply, impactfully control the system. In other words, no human or humans control it now, anymore, nor will ever again.

That these days, in our vastly complicated, massive system, moving forward at a (still) growingly difficult to keep-up pace that it has outgrown our ability to control, in ways we once had, we are prsently dwarfed by its size and momentum.

You see, we have an implicit & dependent relationship with our system, because not only did we create it for order, but we use it to maintain order, like homes with parents for their aspiring children. The relationship we have between the system itself and us, holds us to what we continously create upon it, as a necessity in order to provide stability, security and hopefully prosperity. But, the system is vastly complicated, made up of a multitude of sub-systems from culture to politics and economics. Some of it changes fast like culture or technology, while some of it changes slow like politics and law. Yet, collectively, it guides us upon a path, by a form of marriage.

For centuries now, things have been in motion, building up momentum, defining more rigid structures, becoming in a way real... metaphysically that the system, through us, has has grown bigger than our collective species, an entity that we must be keep going, keep alive, even though it has no breath to breath. But, we depend on it to secure our breath of life.

However, the system is not alive. It's not divine. It does not have any capacities to feel, grow, like you or me. It does not empthatize nor conceptualize what is happening around the world. In its own way, it stands vulnerable. It's foundational layers like law and economics are slow to change. Thus, when crisis emerges from unknown or misunderstood causes, the solution tends to be a reactive, based on precedents, by strengthening further the system in ways such as consolidating banks that are too big to fail. Putting more resources to surfaces of the system that expose great risk to security of order.

To stabilize economics, to protect peace, for future prosperity or whatever causes claim, more and more, the system gets bigger and stronger, in its set ways, to the point that perhaps no human or humans can truly, even with advanced tools, conceive it in its entirety, to effect true of control it, to actually influence its our paths, destiny, that fate itself has now become set - through this marriage of human beings and this, so well defined yet so complicated of a system, we create and maintain.

Thus, it's possible that in recent times, given our relationship with the system, and how things are, that we are no longer the choosers of it's (and inevitably our's) paths any longer that the system itself, in our entangled state with it, keeps its and inevitably our paths set, linearly forward, without significant changing. From rich to poor. From powerful to weak. All those who attempt to live, to exist with, essentially interface the system, and thus cannot avoid its structures, rules, and firmly held viewpoints, as laid out on its path of proven precedent.

We are married to it, for better or worse, until death do us part.

# Wheat

So perhaps, things may seem secretly in control by some all powerful mastermind(s), all seeing entity, because it actually is, but it's not human. That really the very system itself, that we once created and now maintain metaphysically, implicitly controls us, in a state of dependent, reduced optionality, rigidly protected by collective precedent.

        Optionality is a sign of wealth, an effect of a healthy system.

        That through our relationship with it, like children to parents, we no longer choose the beginning of our destiny but at best, have our destinies starting point set, as we ride along the path that the system so diligently holds us too.

That even through each other, we do the work of the system, in reminding each other, reminding ourselves, to be held to the standards of the system. We defend the system because deep down, we feel utterly fragile without it, naked, almost alone in a cold dark alley.

That like wheat, the system holds human beings to a path that is both ordered and exposed to risks of stagnation.

Things have become so massive, that the populations of wheat and human have grown so big, that we have no other choice but to stay with it, even if it prevents us from fixing things. Otherwise, we could lose people who mean so much to us.

That the system, like wheat, holds us in a box, our relaionship domesticating us, as we intended, but unchanging, vulnerable and possibly growingly exposed.

Fucking wheat.
