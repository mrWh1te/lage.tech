# Arch

> Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose GNU/Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.

## Personal setup

This setup focuses on my favorite applications, services, and drivers. It skips the initial Arch linux setup.

### Take screenshots
[scrot]() is a CLI tool for generating screenshots, including thumbnails i.e.
```bash
scrot -t 20 -d 5
```
The file is png with a dated filename. The flags are:
- -t Thumbnail percentage size from original i.e. 20%
- -d Delay in seconds before taking the screenshot i.e. 5 seconds
