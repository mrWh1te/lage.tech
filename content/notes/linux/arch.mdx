# Arch

> Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose GNU/Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.

## Personal setup

This setup is a style of favorite applications, services, and drivers. It ignores everything related to the [initial Arch linux setup](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide).

### Manual
Offline access to a [manual](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-creating-a-manpage/) of all your CLI tools.
```bash
man dwm # Manual page on DWM, ie keyboard shortcuts
```
> Mod1 is the alt key on the US keyboard layout

[Helpful Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Man_page)

### Windows Tiling Manager
Replace (or use with) a Desktop Environment. The primary objective is automating the layout of application windows, however, many go beyond in building interactive User flows that mostly increase speed of which one interfaces a typical desktop computer. For example, use keyboard short-cuts to "tile" windows on screen to keep your hands on the keyboard.

Trying out [dwm](dwm).

#### Patches & other
- launch applications, create dynamic menus [dmenu](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dmenu)

#### CLI Tools
Given how fast shell based Windows open in [dwm](dwm), having GUI like CLI alternatives can expediate your work-flow.

Trying out the following:
- file-management [ranger](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ranger)
- terminal emulation [st](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/St)
- monitoring tool (hardware status, processes) [htop](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-htop-on-arch-linux/) ([read more](https://www.linuxtechi.com/htop-monitor-linux-system-processes/))
- reading text (unix pipe in) or files [less](https://www.howtogeek.com/444233/how-to-use-the-less-command-on-linux/)
- print computer brand [screenfetch](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=screenfetch)

### Wifi
Arch did not include a DHCP client in the bare-install (following the Arch wiki). I ended up having most success with [dhcpcd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dhcpcd) to get an IP. After determining my hardware's chipset, I was able to find a driver that supported it. Also, it's possible to find the driver through the hardware's device-id. Once the wifi interface showed up on [ip link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_configuration#Network_interfaces), I was able to form a wireless connection with an encrypted Wifi using [iwctl](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Iwd#iwctl).

### Nvidia
Trying out the [Nvidia driver](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA) for Geforce 1060 6GB card.

### Steam
Valve officially supports Ubuntu. The [steam]() package may install with missing libraries/dependencies ([resolve with this guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Steam/Troubleshooting_#Finding_missing_runtime_libraries)). My setup required an additional font & 32bit lib packages.

My computer streams on local Wifi to a networked Steam Link better, when running Arch, as opposed to Windows. ðŸ’ªðŸ¤©

### Chat
Slack has the `slack-desktop` package in the package-manager. Recommend you use `pacman` to install instead, instead of manually installing it from their website, to let `pacman` manage updates for you.

Apps:
- [Slack](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/slack-desktop/) 
- [Discord](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Discord)

todo Zoom

### Emoji's

Express yourself with a font that has emoji's like [noto-fonts-emoji](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/noto-fonts-emoji/) ([guide](ttps://dev.to/darksmile92/get-emojis-working-on-arch-linux-with-noto-fonts-emoji-2a9)).

### Take screenshots
[scrot]() is a CLI tool for generating screenshots, including thumbnails i.e.
```bash
scrot -t 20 -d 5
```
The file is png with a dated filename. The flags are:
- -t Thumbnail percentage size from original i.e. 20%
- -d Delay in seconds before taking the screenshot i.e. 5 seconds

### NTFS support
Support NTFS partitions (i.e. Windows file-systems).

Install the [ntfs-3g package](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NTFS-3G). Then mount the corresponding file-system partition(s), i.e.:
```bash
sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sdd2 /mnt/windows
```
