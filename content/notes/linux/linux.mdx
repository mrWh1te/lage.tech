# Linux

Linux is modular. There are many choices for each part.

### Display Manager (login manager)

GUI to display at the end of the boot process, in place of the default shell. It's intended to display a Login form to begin a User session.

### Display Server

> A <b>display server</b> or <i>window server</i> is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system, the hardware, and each other.

### Desktop Environment

- KDE, Gnome, Xfce

### systemd

> systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system. systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.

### Package Manager

Arch Linux comes with `pacman`, to install packages such as applications, i.e.:
```bash
pacman -S slack
```
Flag:
- -S install package
