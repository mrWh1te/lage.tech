# Dynmamic Window Manager (DWM)

dwm is a bare-bones window tiling manager. It replaces the Desktop Environment such as KDE, Gnome, Xfce, but can be made to work with them, if you prefer.

dwm default install comes with the bare minimum "sandbox", like a playground to add toys (patches) that extend the base functionality with whatever you want.

The installation is preferably done manually by cloning, making (building), and installing locally.

## Tags

Tags are similar to Workspaces, but not the samething. The Windows that are displayed on a screen, depend on which Tags are active.

For example, you can have apps tiled in windows tagged 3 and others tagged in 4. Activate Tag 3, see only Tag 3's windows laid out. Left-click Tag 4 in the Top Bar, see only Tag 4's windows laid out. But, right-click Tag 4 with Tag 3 active will activate Tag 4 in addition to keeping Tag 3 active. Now all Windows of both Tags are displayed in the active layout.

So Tags are just Tags, they "mark" Windows with groups to choose which Windows are laid out on screen.

Therefore, the active Tag numbers' associated Windows will display in the active Layout style.
