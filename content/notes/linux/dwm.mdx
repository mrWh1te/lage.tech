# Dynmamic Window Manager (DWM)

dwm is a bare-bones window tiling manager. It replaces the Desktop Environment such as KDE, Gnome, Xfce, but can be made to work with them, if you prefer.

dwm default install comes with the bare minimum "sandbox", like a playground to add toys (patches) that extend the base functionality with whatever you want.

The installation is preferably done manually by cloning, making (building), and installing locally.

## Tags

Tags are similar to Workspaces, but not the samething. The Windows that are displayed on a screen, depend on which Tags are active.

For example, you can have applications tiled in windows with Tag 3 and others tagged 4. If only Tag 3 is active, than only Tag 3's windows will be laid out. You can activate multiple Tags by right-clicking on them in the Top Bar. Then all Windows associated with those Tags are laid out before you.

Tags are like "markers" that can group Windows for displaying by toggling.

## Helpful keyboard shortcuts

Note that "alt" here represents "Mod1" in the manual. By default, "Mod1" in US keyboard layout maps to the left "alt" key, but can be changed i.e. to the [Windows key](https://dwm.suckless.org/customisation/windows_key/).
