## GraphQL Code Generator
[GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) is an amazing tool for getting started with implementing GraphQL in different environments. If you're writing your schema, queries, mutations with GraphQL files, you can take those to generate various language types from the GQL object types, generate react hooks based on the queries, generate strongly typed `Resolvers` to base the api's resolvers on and more! It's helpful by cutting down development time, while increasing dev confidence with its strong typing. Using the generated types from a single source reduces dissonance between the backend and frontend, making atomic changes simpler.
