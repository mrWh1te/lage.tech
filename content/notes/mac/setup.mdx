# MacOS

These notes reflect on a personal Macbook Pro setup based on the M1 chip.

## Basics

By following this [tutorial](https://blog.logrocket.com/set-up-macbook-for-web-development-in-20-minutes/), one is able to get started quicker by installing multiple apps (if not most of them) with a single bash script using homebrew.

> If you're using NodeJS, comment out `node` from that tutorial's bash script, since it will be installed & managed by `nvm`, which is manually installed at the end of that tutorial.

### Sidecar
Recent iPads have a feature as an app to extend your Macbook's screen unto the iPad, as an additional monitor.

I ran into issues with this, specifically with getting the iPad to use iCloud Drive (a requirement). Once setting up my account to support iCloud Drive through the [iCloud website](http://icloud.com/), then the iPad begun using it. The Settings Menu to toggle iCloud Drive's prompt for using it would not work.
